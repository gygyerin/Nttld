          <h4>1. A T-shaped Nickel(I) Metalloradical Species</h4>
          <pre>
A T-shaped Ni(I) complex was synthesized using a rifid acridane-based pincer ligand to prepare a metalloradical center. Structural data disiplays a nickel ion is embedded in the plane of a PNP ligand. Having a stericallly exposed half-filled d_(x^2-y^2) orbital, this three including the homolytic cleavage of various sigma-bonds, such as H-H, N-N, and C-C.

        <h4>3. A Dinuclear Ni(I) System Having a Diradical Ni2N2 Diamond Core
Resting State: Synthetic, Structural, Spectroscopic Elucidation, and
Reductive Bond Splitting Reactions</h4>
<pre>
  One-electron reduction of the square-planar nickel precursor (PNP)NiCl (1) (PNP- ) N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2) with KC8 effects ligand reorganization of the pincer ligand to assemble a Ni(I) dimer, [Ni(¬µ2-PNP)]2 (2), containing a Ni2N2 core structure, as inferred by its solid-state X-ray structure. Solution magnetization measurements are consistent with a paramagnetic Ni(I) system likely undergoing a monomer T dimer equilibrium. The room-temperature and 4 K solid-state X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra display anisotropic signals. Lowtemperature solid-state X-band EPR data at 4 K reveal rhombic values gz ) 1.980(4), gx ) 2. 380(4), and gy ) 2.225(4), as well as a forbidden signal at g ) 4.24 for the ‚àÜMS ) 2 half field transition, in accord with 2 having two weakly interacting metal centers. Utilizing an S ) 1 model, full spin Hamiltonian simulation of the low-temperature EPR spectrum on the solid sample was achieved by applying a nonzero zero-field-splitting parameter (D ) 0.001 cm-1 ), which is consistent with an S ) 0 ground state with a very closely lying S ) 1 state. Solid-state magnetization data also corroborate well with our solid-state EPR data and reveal weak antiferromagnetic behavior (J ) -1.52(5) cm-1 ) over a 2-300 K temperature range at a field of 1 Tesla. Evidence for 2 being a masked ‚Äú(PNP)Ni‚Äù scaffold originates from its reaction with N2CPh2, which traps the Ni(I) monomer in the form of a T-shaped species, Ni(PNPdNNCPh2), a system that has been structurally characterized. The radical nature of complex 2, or its monomer component, is well manifested through the plethora of cooperative H-X-type bond cleavage reactions, providing the nickel(II) hydride (PNP)NiH and the corresponding rare functionalities -OH, -OCH3, -PHPh, and -B(catechol) integrated into the (PNP)Ni moiety in equal molar amounts. In addition to splitting H2, compound 2 can also engage in homolytic X-X bond cleavage reactions of PhXXPh to form (PNP)Ni(XPh) (X ) S or Se).

<h4>4. Chemistry of Reduced Monomeric and Dimeric Cobalt Complexes
Supported by a PNP Pincer Ligand</h4>
<pre>
  The reduction chemistry of cobalt complexes with HPNP (HPNP = HN(CH2CH2Pi
Pr2)2) as a supporting ligand is described. Reaction of [(HPNP)CoCl2] (1) with n-BuLi generated both the deprotonated Co(II) species [(PNP)CoCl] (2) along with the Co(I) complex [(HPNP)CoCl] (3). Products resulting from reduction of 2 with KC8 vary depending upon the atmosphere under which the reduction is performed. Monomeric square planar [(PNP)CoN2] (4) is obtained under dinitrogen, whereas dimeric [(PNP)Co]2 (5) is formed under argon. Over time, 5 activates a C‚àíH bond in the PNP ligand to form the species [Co(H)(Œº-PNP)(Œºi Pr2PCH2CH2NCHCH2Pi Pr2)Co] (6). We also observed the oxidative addition of H‚àíSi bond to complex 3 to form [(HPNP)CoCl(H)SiH2Ph] (7). 1H NMR studies showed that species 7 is in equilibrium with 3 and silane in solution. Complex 3 can be oxidized with AgBPh4 to generate {(HPNP)CoCl}BPh4 (8), a square planar species with a formal electron count of 15 electrons.

<h5>5. Influence of the d-Electron Count on CO Binding by Three-Coordinate
[(tBu2PCH2SiMe2)2N]Fe, -Co, and -Ni</h5>
<pre>
  Reduction of (PNP)MCl [PNP ) (tBu2PCH2SiMe2)2N] with Mg gives three-coordinate, T-shaped (PNP)M for M ) Fe(S ) 3/2) and Ni. Their reactivity was tested toward CO; Ni binds one CO, but only reversibly (i.e., CO is completely lost in vacuum), and has a CO stretching frequency showing effective back-donation by NiI . The structure of (PNP)Ni(CO) is intermediate between planar and tetrahedral, in contrast to the planar d8 analogue, (PNP)Co(CO). This structural reorganization on carbonylation changes the singly occupied molecular orbital from having negligible phosphorus character [no P hyperfine structure in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of (PNP)Ni] to having enough P character to have a triplet structure in the EPR spectrum of the CO. The presence of one fewer electron in (PNP)Fe (vs the Co analogue) leads to binding of two CO, and (PNP)Fe(CO)2 is characterized as a spin doublet with square-pyramidal structure. Density functional theory calculations strengthen the understanding of the structural and spectroscopic changes along this dn series (n) 7‚àí9).
