          <h4>6. Formation of Ethylene-Bridged Dinuclear IrIII Species via M−C Coupling of IrII and IrII(ethene)</h4>
          <pre>
Ethene dissociation from [(Mentpa)IrII(ethene)]2+, induced by coordination of acetonitrile, causes a rapid and selective M−C coupling between IrII and IrII(ethene), resulting in ethylene-bridged dinuclear iridium(III) complexes of the composition [{(Mentpa)IrIII(NCMe)}2(μ2-C2H4)]4+ (n = 2, 3).

<h4>7. Formation and ethene substrate reactions of iridium(II) porphyrin metal-centered dπ radicals</h4>
<pre>
  Monomeric iridium(II) porphyrin complexes of tetrakis(2,4,6-trialkylphenyl)porphyrin ligands that are generated by photolysis of the Ir–Me derivatives are found to have the dxy2 dz22 dxz,yz3 ground electron configuration which differs from the dxy2 dxz,yz4 dz21 configuration observed for the Co(II) and Rh(II) analogs; reactions of these Ir(II) species with ethene reflect both the metallo-radical reactivity and the varying steric demands for the series of porphyrin ligands.

<h4>8. Mechanistic Study on C–C Bond Formation of a Nickel(I) Monocarbonyl Species with Alkyl Iodides: Experimental and Computational Investigations</h4>
<pre>
  An open-shell reaction of the nickel(I) carbonyl species (PNP)Ni-CO (1) with iodoalkanes has been explored experimentally and theoretically. The initial iodine radical abstraction by a nickel(I) carbonyl species was suggested to produce (PNP)Ni-I (4) and the concomitant alkyl radical, according to a series of experimental indications involving stoichiometric controls employing iodoalkanes. Corresponding alkyl radical generation was also confirmed by radical trapping experiments using Gomberg’s dimer. Molecular modeling supports that the nickel acyl species (PNP)Ni-COCH3 (2) can be formed by a direct C–C bond formation between a carbonyl ligand of 1 and a methyl radical. As an alternative pathway, the five-coordinate intermediate species (PNP)Ni(CO)(CH3) (5) that involves both CO and CH3 binding at a nickel(II) center is also suggested with a comparable activation barrier, although this pathway energetically favors the formation of (PNP)Ni-CH3 (3) via a barrierless elimination of CO over a CO migratory insertion. Thus, our present work supports that the direct C–C bond coupling occurs between an alkyl radical and the carbonyl ligand at a monovalent nickel center in the generation of an acyl product.

<h4>9. Addition of Alkyl Radicals to Transition-Metal-Coordinated CO:  Calculation of the Reaction of [Ru(CO)5] and Related Complexes and Relevance to Alkane Carbonylation</h4>
<pre>
  Electronic structure methods have been used to study the transition state and products of the reaction between alkyl radicals and CO coordinated in transition-metal complexes. At the B3LYP DFT level, methyl addition to a carbonyl of [Ru(CO)5] or [Ru(CO)3(dmpe)] is calculated to be about 6 kcal/mol more exothermic than addition to free CO. In contrast, methyl addition to [Mo(CO)6] is 12 kcal/mol less exothermic than addition to CO, while the reaction enthalpy of methyl addition to [Pd(CO)4] is comparable to that of free CO. Related results are obtained at the CCSD-T level and for the reactions of the cyclohexyl radical. The transition state for these reactions is characterized by significant distortion of the geometry of the reactant complex, which include lengthening and bending of the M−CO bond, but with negligible C−C bond formation. Accordingly, the activation energy for addition to coordinated carbonyls is 2−10 kcal/mol greater than that of addition to free CO. Additional calculations were also carried out on representative unsaturated metal carbonyls. The calculated results afford an understanding of the mechanism of previously reported photochemical alkane carbonylation systems utilizing d8-ML5 metal carbonyls as cocatalysts. In particular, it is strongly indicated that such systems operate via direct attack by an alkyl radical at a CO ligand, a reaction that has not previously been proposed.

  My comment : Cited by 8. as uncommon open-shell C-C bond formatin of transition-metal coordinated CO. 읽기 쉽고 논리도 명확하고 이해하기 쉬웠다. 그러나 supporting 정도의 역할만 했던 DFT calculation으로, 논문에서도 불완전성을 계속 경고했는데 JACS에서 인정받았다는 게 놀라웠다. 심지어 본인들의 실험에 대한 것도 아닌데. 2007년에는 이런 내용의 논문이 드물었나. 정독한 논문 중 길이가 제일 길어서 뿌듯했음.

<h4>10. Synthesis and Reactivity of Two-Coordinate Ni(I) Alkyl and Aryl Complexes</h4>
<pre>
  Reaction of [(IPr)Ni(μ-Cl)]2 (1-Cl; IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene) with ClMg{CH(SiMe3)2}·Et2O affords (IPr)Ni{CH(SiMe3)2} (2), a two-coordinate Ni(I) alkyl complex. An analogous two-coordinate aryl derivative, (IPr)Ni(dmp) (dmp = 2,6-dimesitylphenyl), can be similarly prepared from Li(dmp) and 1-Cl. Reaction of 2 with alkyl bromides gives the three-coordinate Ni(II) alkyl halide complex (IPr)Ni{CH(SiMe3)2}Br. Evidence for a radical mechanism is presented to explain the reaction of 2 with alkyl halides.
